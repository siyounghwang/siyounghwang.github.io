I am a Ph.D. candidate in International Economics and Finance at Brandeis University, researching how trade policy and global value chains intersect with environmental sustainability. My work examines the effects of the Koreaâ€“US Free Trade Agreement on global value chain participation and investigates the role of tariffs and broader trade policies in advancing Net Zero Emissions goals. I have taught graduate courses on trade policy, econometrics with R, and communication in economics, and served as a teaching assistant for courses in macroeconomics, development, and principles of economics.
