title: "What is the Eﬀect of the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement on Global Value Chains?"

excerpt: 'This paper shows that the Korea–US Free Trade Agreement increased U.S. auto imports from Korea by $4.8 billion annually and reduced U.S. agricultural exports by $0.7 billion. Using synthetic controls, I find that the FTA shifted trade toward less global value chain (GVC) intensive forms: auto imports rose in both GVC and non-GVC trade, while agriculture exports saw a decline in GVC trade and a rise in non-GVC trade. These results highlight that focusing only on trade volumes overlooks how FTAs reshape the structure of global value chain participation.'

This paper finds that the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement (FTA) increased US auto imports from Korea on average by $4.8 billion per year and decreased US agriculture exports to Korea by $0.7 billion per year using synthetic controls to estimate the treatment effect. However, when evaluating the treatment effect on the share of trade that is part of a global value chain (GVC), I find that for US auto imports from Korea, the FTA increased the share of both GVC and non-GVC trade by 0.3 percentage points. For US agriculture exports to Korea, it decreased the share of GVC trade by 3.3 percentage points and increased the share of non-GVC trade by 2.2 percentage points. Interestingly for both sectors, after the FTA the trend of the share of GVC trade in exports changed from an upward trend to a downward trend suggesting that the FTA changed the nature of the trade to more non-GVC intensive and less GVC intensive. These findings suggest that evaluating the effects of an FTA on only exports and imports completely misses the effects FTAs have on trade that is involved in global value chains.
